RethinkDB Evaluation
====================

I'm using this project to get a feel for what it's like to use RethinkDB in an actual application.

To run:
1. Install node.js and RethinkDB and start RethinkDB.
2. Clone this project and cd to it's directory.
3. run 'npm install'
4. run 'node init_db' (if you want to start with the test data).
5. run 'npm start'
6. Visit http://localhost:8739
